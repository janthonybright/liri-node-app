# Liri-Node-App
In this assignment I built a LIRI app for Boot Camp week 10. This app uses node and api's to pull content results, if the user has a need to search for content they have interest in.

## Instruction Break Down
1. Clone this repo down to your local system
2. Open your terminal and file the directory the app is located
3. In your terminal command line type "node liri.js"
4. After the first two commands in the process line type any of the following commands:
    - "movie-this"
    - "spotify-this-song"
    - "concert-this"
    - "do-what-it-says"
5. Lastly type in your content you want to review.

*any of the follwing examples will do*

    - "movie-this Men In Black"
    - "spotify-this-song Take On Me"
    - "concert-this Phantogram"
  
Also below is a video that has a demonstration of the app running and working. Enjoy!
